# CineGit Project Summary

## Introduction

CineGit is envisioned as a cloud-native platform designed to revolutionize video editing and filmmaking workflows by introducing Git-style version control and collaboration tools. The core concept is to address the inefficiencies and lack of structured versioning in current creative media production processes. By enabling features like timeline branching, visual diffing of edits, collaborative review tools, and secure media management, CineGit aims to become the definitive collaboration hub for creative teams, akin to what GitHub represents for software development.

## Market Need and Opportunity

The project identifies a significant gap in the market. Current practices often involve chaotic file management (e.g., multiple "final" versions) and lack robust mechanisms for parallel creative exploration (branching) or merging contributions from different editors seamlessly. Existing cloud storage and review platforms like Frame.io or Dropbox offer collaboration features but do not provide the granular, Git-inspired version control for timelines and assets that CineGit proposes. This presents a clear opportunity to offer a specialized solution catering to the unique needs of video production teams, from independent creators to large studios.

## Target Audience

CineGit targets a diverse range of users within the video production ecosystem. Key personas include Indie Editors working in remote teams who need efficient, low-overhead collaboration and safe branching capabilities; YouTubers requiring rapid content iteration, review, and version management; Studio Production Managers overseeing large teams and complex approval workflows needing robust access control and audit trails; and VFX Houses managing high volumes of assets, requiring features like proxy generation, visual diffing, and stringent media security.

## Core Features (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on delivering the foundational elements of the version control workflow. This includes robust timeline versioning, secure asset uploading and management, a system for branching timelines to explore different creative directions, a "Cut Request" feature (analogous to Pull Requests) for merging timeline changes, a visual tool to compare differences between timeline versions (highlighting insertions, deletions, and moves), frame-accurate commenting for reviews, role-based access control to manage permissions, and comprehensive activity logs for tracking project history.

## Technology and Architecture

The proposed system architecture is based on a modern microservices approach running on Kubernetes (EKS). The frontend is planned using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS, supporting Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality. A GraphQL API Gateway will serve as the interface to backend microservices written primarily in GoLang, communicating via gRPC. Key backend services include Authentication, Project Management (timelines, branches), Review (comments, cut requests), Media Handling (upload, proxy, diff), Billing (Stripe integration), and Notifications. The media processing layer leverages FFmpeg for transcoding, thumbnail generation, and proxy creation, potentially using WebAssembly for the timeline diff engine. Media assets will be stored securely in versioned S3 buckets and delivered via a CDN (CloudFront or R2). PostgreSQL is proposed for metadata storage, with Redis for caching. Observability will be handled by Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, while security measures include encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit), signed URLs, WAF, and RBAC.

## Business Model and Future Vision

CineGit plans a tiered subscription model, including a Freemium option with basic limits, a Studio plan for professional teams, a Per-Project option for short-term needs, and a customizable Enterprise tier. The post-MVP roadmap includes advanced features like AI-assisted merge conflict resolution, offline sync capabilities, automatic proxy generation, plugins for popular Non-Linear Editing software (Premiere, Resolve, FCPX), and integrations with cloud rendering farms. Future directions explore public repositories for open-source film projects, AI-driven edit suggestions, and potential monetization APIs.
