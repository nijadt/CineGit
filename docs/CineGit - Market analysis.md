## Problem Assessment

**Current Challenges in Video Editing Workflows:**

- Multiple conflicting versions of project files (e.g., `final_v3_FINAL.mp4`)
- No way to experiment or collaborate in parallel without overwriting work
- Lack of diffing/merge tools for timeline edits
- Comments and approvals spread across email, chat, and cloud storage
- Disjointed upload/download workflows with security risks

**CineGit solves this by:**

- Introducing **timeline versioning, branching, and merging** akin to Git
- Enabling **frame-accurate commenting**, threaded discussions, and cut requests
- Automating **media proxy generation, diff visualization**, and structured approvals
- Managing **secure, multi-tenant media storage** with CDN delivery and role-based access
